  description: `Some Villain cards have a special ability called "Conqueror," representing their desire to conquer and hold a specific part of the city. For example, the Chitauri Soldier Villain has the ability "Rooftops Conqueror 2." This ability means This Villain gets +2 Attack while any Villain is in the rooftops." So the Chitauri Soldier gets this Attack bonus while it itself on the Rooftops, or when a completely different Villain is on the Rooftops. The Chitauri Soldier doesn't care if the Villain on the Rooftops has a Conqueror ability or not. Other Villains and the Iron Monger Mastermind have different Conqueror abilities, with different Attack bonus numbers and referring to different city spaces.`,
