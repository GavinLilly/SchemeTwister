  description: `The new "Wall-Crawl" keyword lets Heroes set up powerful combos by placing cards at the top of their decks. "Wall-Crawl" means:
"When you recruit this Hero, you may put it on top of your deck."
With Wall-Crawl, you get to use your new Hero much faster than you would if that Hero went in your discard pile. Keep an eye out for powerful combos you can create if you recruit a Wall-Crawl Hero early in your turn, before you play cards that reveal the top card of your deck.
<ul><li>Remember: When you use Wall-Crawl to put a card on top of your deck, don't use any other abilities on that card until it gets drawn from your deck. If you "gain" a Hero through some special ability like Skrull Shapeshifters, you can't use Wall-Crawl because you didn't "recruit" that Hero.</li></ul>`,
