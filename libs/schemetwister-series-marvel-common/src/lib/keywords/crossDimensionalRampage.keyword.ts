<ul>
  <li>"Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage" means "Each player reveals one of their Hulk Heroes or a Hulk card in their Victory Pile or gains a Wound."</li>
  <li>You can reveal any card that includes the word "Hulk" in its card name, Hero name, Villain Group name, or Tactics for Hulk Masterminds. This includes any Red Hulk, She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, Skaar, Son of Hulk, Joe Fixit Grey Hulk, Hulkling, Hulk Gang, Cosmic Hulk Robot, Hulkbuster, Enchain the Hulk, and so on.</li>
  <li>You don't need to know the whole history of Marvel comics to judge who counts as a Hulk - just rely on whether the card says Hulk in its name or not. There are only a few, very specific exceptions we have to make to stay true to the characters:
    <ul>
      <li>"Nul, Breaker of Worlds" from Fear Itself and "Maestro" (core set) count as Hulks for this.</li>
      <li>"Weapon X" and "Old Man Logan" count as Wolverines for "Cross-Dimensional Wolverine Rampage" in other sets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some Heroes in this set can transform into Hulks, like Bruce Banner and Amadeus Cho. A puny "Bruce Banner" card doesn't say "Hulk" on it, so it can't stop a Hulk Rampage. But revealing the transformed Bruce Banner card named "Savage Hulk Unleashed" works.</li>
  <li>When a Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage happens, you can choose to gain the Wound, even if you have a Hulk that you already played or could otherwise reveal. You might want the Wound if you have Wounded Fury cards.</li>
  <li>There are also Cross-Dimensional Void Rampages, etc.</li>
</ul>`,
