  description: `Some Ally cards in this set are "Thrown Artifacts". These are Artifact cards that the player can "throw" at the perfect moment.
<ul>
<li>To "throw" a Thrown Artifact, put it on the bottom of your deck and use its ability.</li>
<li>You can throw as many Artifacts as you want in a turn. You can only throw during your turn.</li>
<li>If a card effect like Rogue, Chameleon, or Star-Lord would let you "copy" a Thrown Artifact card, use that Artifact's "When you throw this" ability once, and there is no other effect. (Don't put anything on the bottom of your deck.)</li>
</ul>`,
