  description: `"Dodge" means "During your turn, you may discard this card from your hand to draw another card." Many Dodge cards have conditional effects so that sometimes you want to play them, and sometimes you want to Dodge them away. Dodge also helps you sculpt your hand towards Recruit Points or Attack as you desire.
<ul>
<li>When you Dodge a card from your hand, ignore all the other text on that card.</li>
<li>When you Dodge a card from your hand, you didn't "play" that card, so the Dodged card's Ally (Hero) Class/color doesn't help you use the Superpower abilities of other cards you play that turn.</li>
<li>Some Allies in the Villains set count the number of cards you discarded this turn. This includes cards you discarded with Dodge.</li>
</ul>`,
