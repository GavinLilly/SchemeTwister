  description: `Far beyond other Heroes that can stretch or grow, Ant-Man and Wasp can change their size to a whole new scale. They can shrink down smaller than an atom, to the quantum Microverse. Here, the very laws of physics can be broken and even reversed! This ability works like regular Size- Changing, but with a couple of twists.
<ul>
<li>Some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "Microscopic Size-Changing ${HeroClass.TECH} ${HeroClass.TECH} ${HeroClass.TECH}."</li>
<li>This means "You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less for each ${HeroClass.TECH} card you played this turn, counting up to three ${HeroClass.TECH} cards."</li>
<li>So if you played one ${HeroClass.TECH} Hero this turn, this card costs 2 less. If you played two ${HeroClass.TECH} Heroes, it costs 4 less. If you played three or more ${HeroClass.TECH} Heroes, it costs 6 less.</li>
<li>Playing a fourth ${HeroClass.TECH} card wouldn’t reduce this cost any further since there are only three ${HeroClass.TECH} icons listed in this particular Microscopic Size- Changing ability.</li>
<li>The second twist is that Microscopic Size- Changing can actually reduce a card’s Recruit cost to zero or even a negative number! When you recruit a Microscopic Size-Changing Hero with a negative cost, you actually gain that many Recruit points!</li>
<li>Some Villains also have Microscopic Size- Changing. It works the same way, letting you fight that Villain for 2 Attack less for each card of the correct color you played this turn, counting up to the number of icons shown in the Microscopic Size-Changing ability.</li>
<li>Likewise, if you fight a Villain with Microscopic Size-Changing and reduce its Attack value to a negative number, you actually gain that many Attack points when you fight it. You don’t even need to have any Attack points before you fight them.</li>
<li>For example, say you play five ${HeroClass.COVERT} Heroes, then fight a Villain with 3 Attack and "Microscopic Size-Changing ${HeroClass.COVERT} ${HeroClass.COVERT} ${HeroClass.COVERT} ${HeroClass.COVERT}." The Villain's Attack decreases to -5, and you actually gain 5 Attack when you fight them! (The 5th ${HeroClass.COVERT} Hero you played didn’t reduce the Attack, since the Microscopic Size- Changing ability only had 4 icons.)</li>
<li>Building the right deck and shrinking down to the crazy backwards physics of the Microverse can create some very powerful turns!</li>
</ul>`,
