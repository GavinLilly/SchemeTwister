  description: `This keyword represents Spider-Man using his famous "Spider-Sense" superpower to detect danger and evade it. It also covers Tony Stark, Happy Hogan, and Vulture watching for threats and rapidly reacting to them.
<ul>
  <li>Some cards say things like "Danger Sense 2." This means "Reveal the top 2 cards of the Villain Deck. You get +1 Attack for each Villain you revealed. Put all the cards back on top in any order."</li>
  <li>Cards can say Danger Sense 1, 2, 3, or even 4, revealing that many cards.</li>
  <li>Several Danger Sense cards also say they have additional effects when they reveal particular kinds of cards.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you can use one Danger Sense card to put a particular card on top of the Villain Deck, and then use a different Danger Sense card to benefit from that card being on top of that deck.</li>
  <li>Danger Sense can also be a good way to delay nasty Scheme Twists, Master Strikes, and powerful Villains. But you won't be able to avoid them forever!</li>
</ul>`,
