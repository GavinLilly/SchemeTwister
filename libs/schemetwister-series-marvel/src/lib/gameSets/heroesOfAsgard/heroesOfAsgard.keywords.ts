  description: `Many Marvel stories involve Thor and others proving whether they are worth of wielding Asgard's mightiest weapons, like Mjolnir and Stormbreaker. This is represented by the new "Worthy" keyword. Some Hero cards say things like "If you are Worthy, draw a card."
<ul>
  <li>You are Worthy if you have a Hero that costs 5 or more.</li>
  <li>As usual, the phrases "your Heroes" and "Heroes you have" include both cards in your hand and cards you have played this turn. They also include Hero Artifacts you control. (Heroes in your deck and discard pile don't count.)</li>
  <li>Some Villains and Schemes also check if you are Worthy and reward or punish you accordingly.</li>
  <li>When you consider whether to recruit a card that asks you to be Worthy, you may find yourself hesitating, wondering whether you truly have enough to prove Worthy at the crucial moment. This is a great fit to how Thor and other Heroes question whether they will be Worthy at the crucial moment in Marvel stories.</li>
</ul>`,
