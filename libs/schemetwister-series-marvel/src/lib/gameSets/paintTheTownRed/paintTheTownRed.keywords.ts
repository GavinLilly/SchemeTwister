  description: `Feast: The new Mastermind Carnage and his "Maximum Carnage" followers use the gruesome new Feast keyword. "Feast" states that when you fight a Villain or Mastermind with this ability you treat it as a fight effect. IE:
"Feast" = "Fight: KO the top card of your deck."
Some Maximum Carnage Villains create special effects when they feast on certain cards
<ul>
<li>Carnage's Master Strike starts with "Feast on each player." That means each player does the "Feast" effect. Then Carnage's Master Strike causes Wounds when he feasts on certain cards.</li>
<li>Note that Carnage's Master Strike is the only effect that feasts on every player. The "Maximum Carnage" Villains and Carnage's Mastermind Tactics each feast on only one player.</li>
<li>While Carnage's Master Strike causes Wounds, the Feast abilities on his Mastermind Tactics and most of his Villains don't cause Wounds.</li>
</ul>`,
